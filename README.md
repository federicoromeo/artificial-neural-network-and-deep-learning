## Image Classification

Problem: classify images depicting groups of people based on the number of masked people. 
In the specific, the solution have to discriminate between images depending on the following classes: 
* All the people in the image are wearing a mask 
* No person in the image is wearing a mask 
* Someone in the image is not wearing a mask

## Image Segmentation
Problem: perform segmentation of images divided into different folders based on the team that acquired the image, i.e., Bipbip, Pead, Roseau, Weedelec. 
For each team, we have two different sub-folders named as the type of crop present in the images, i.e., Haricot and Mais.

## Visual Question Answering (VQA)



Problem: The dataset is composed by synthetic scenes (see examples below), in which people and objects interact, and by corresponding questions,
which are about the content of the images. Given an image and a question, the goal is to provide the correct answer.
